A Game of cards usually involving two players by default
but it can be played by more than one (But is Not implemented)

===========
How to Play
===========
When/After you get your cards...
The first player plays (you or the computer)
the card played must always correspond with the last card present in the played cards
This means that if the last played card was something like 'Triangle' with the
number 5, the next player has to play a card having either 'Triangle' or having
the number 5, else it'll be regarded as an invalid move
If the player to play does not possess a valid card, he/she must go to the market

* Note: Once a player goes to market, he/she has to wait for the opponent to play or
go to market before he/she can play again

If/When a Player has only one card left, it's declared as his last card
If/When a Player plays his last card, Its Checkmate (The player is the winner!)...
